# Purpose:

As students, both undergraduate and graduate, we often find ourselves burdened with immense stress arising from various sources. Whether it's the current job market uncertainty, specific job limitations for international students, the challenge of balancing work and studies simultaneously, or the struggle to allocate time for loved ones and personal interests, etc our overall wellbeing tends to suffer. 

By analyzing lifestyle and wellbeing data, this study aims to shed light on the underlying causes of student stress and explore strategies that can help students lead fulfilling lives in both personal and professional domains. The research will examine primary and secondary datasets to understand the interconnections and impacts of physical, psychological, professional, and social dimensions on overall students' wellbeing.

## Specific objectives of this project include:

     a. Detailed analysis on the dimensions such as studentsâ€™ physical, psychological, professional, and social health.
     b. Analyzing datasets to identify the primary factors influencing stress levels among students.
     c. Investigate the concept of work-life balance and explore strategies to improve productivity while maintaining a healthy balance for students.
     d. Provide insights into how modifying certain habits and behaviors can maximize achievements and wellbeing while minimizing stress levels.
